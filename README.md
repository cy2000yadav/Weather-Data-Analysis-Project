# Project: Weather Data Analysis

Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python and pandas, employing commands like head(), shape, and value_counts.

Implemented robust data cleaning, handling null values, renaming columns, and filtering data based on specific conditions.

Calculated statistical measures for key weather parameters, providing insights into visibility, pressure, wind speed, and relative humidity.

Developed complex queries to extract valuable information, identifying specific weather conditions and exploring parameter correlations.

Utilized matplotlib and seaborn to create informative visualizations, enhancing data interpretability.
